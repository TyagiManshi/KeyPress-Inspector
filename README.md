# KeyPress-Inspector
 A project for practicing Asynchronous JavaScript, the KeyPress Inspector. This project helped me better understand asynchronous programming and is a great addition to my coding journey.  In this project, you can press any key on your keyboard and see it displayed along with its keycode and code.
